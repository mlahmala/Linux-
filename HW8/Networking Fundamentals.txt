(Phase 1)
-After running fping command against the IP range of the Hollywood Database server:
fping -s -g 15.199.95.91/28 shows that the entire range is unreachable
No vulnerabilities to declare in this server.
-After running fping command against the IP range of the Hollywood Web servers:
fping -s -g 15.199.94.91/28  shows that the entire range is unreachable
No vulnerabilities to declare in this server. 

-After running fping command against the IP range of the Hollywood Web server:
fping -s -g 15.199.96.91/28  shows that the entire range is unreachable
No vulnerabilities to declare in this server.

-After running fping command against the IP range of the Hollywood Application server:
fping -s -g 167.172.144.11/32 shows the IP address is alive.
This is a vulnerability.

-After running fping command against the IP range of the Hollywood Application server:
fping -s -g 11.199.141.91/28 shows that the entire range is unreachable.
No vulnerabilities to declare in this server.

-This is happened on network layer.

(Phase 2)

-By running the command nmap -sS 167.172.144.11 it shows a potential vulnerability after finding SSH port:22 is open. I recommend closing the ssh port:22 the soonest the better.
-SYN SCAN find and shows which ports are open, it occurs on the OSI layer 4:Transport.

(Phase3)
-Post subnetting ssh jimi@167.172.144.11
Password:Hendrix
I found the configuration file is /etc/hosts
To view the file, I used cat /etc/hosts
The entry set to 98.137.246.8 rollingstone
To exit the subnetting, I typed exit.nslookup
-nslookup rollingstone.com shows the following:
Server:		8.8.8.8
Address:	8.8.8.8#53
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	rollingstone.com
Address: 151.101.0.69
Name:	rollingstone.com
Address: 151.101.128.69
Name:	rollingstone.com
Address: 151.101.192.69
Name:	rollingstone.com
Address: 151.101.64.69
_nslookup 98.137.246.8 shows the followings:
nslookup 98.137.246.8
8.246.137.98.in-addr.arpa	name = unknown.yahoo.com.
Authoritative answers can be found from:
-The information found indicate that the IP address set with rollingstone.com in /etc/hosts, is not the legitimate IP used by the site rollingstone.com, and that explains why sometimes when the Rockstar corp office tries to access the website, a different, unusual website comes up. This sited IP redirects the traffic to a potential malicious website from the firewall to avoid future redirection to it. These findings also show DNS and HTTP activities, which both occur in the OSI layer 7 :Application.

PHASE 4
-From the packets captured in the activity in the Hollywood office, I have filtered arp.opcode ==1(request) and then arp.opcode == 2(response) I determined that the source VMware_1d:b3:b1 sent a broadcast request.
Two IP address responded, 192.168.47.1 and 192.168.47.200.
192.168.47.200 was found to be a duplicate IP address for two MAC addresses are located in the same location. That concludes an ARP spoofing is occurring.
The illegitimate user of the IP 192.168.47.200 is the user of the device with the MAC address(00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1)
-After running the filter HTTP.request.method == POST, I determined that a Rockstar corps worker sent a message to get the blues corp from an IP source 10.0.2.15 to the IP 104.18.126.89 @http://www.gottheblues.yolasite.com/contact-us.php

-The threats are internal and external, and the best mitigation is to close the port:22,ssh, to block any attempt to hack in from GottheBlues corp and to terminate the untrusty employee from the company and block his access to the Rockstar corp network.
ARP works between layer 2 and 3 since MAC address occurs in data link layer 2 and IPs occur in network layer3.
HTTP is associated with the application layer 7 which provides services for viewing web pages.
